<h2><a name="introduction">Prefatory Note</a></h2>
<br>
When the fourth volume of this series was published three years ago,
many of the critics who had up till then, as Horace Walpole said of God,
been the dearest creatures in the world to me, took another turn. Not
only did they very properly disapprove my choice of poems: they went on
to write as if the Editor of <i>Georgian Poetry</i> were a kind of
public functionary, like the President of the Royal Academy; and they
asked &mdash; again, on this assumption, very properly &mdash; who was E. M. that he
should bestow and withhold crowns and sceptres, and decide that this or
that poet was or was not to count.<br>
<br>
This, in the words of Pirate Smee, was <i>a kind of a compliment</i>,
but it was also, to quote the same hero, <i>galling</i>; and I have
wished for an opportunity of disowning the pretension which I found
attributed to me of setting up as a pundit, or a pontiff, or a Petronius
Arbiter; for I have neither the sure taste, nor the exhaustive reading,
nor the ample leisure which would be necessary in any such role.<br>
<br>
The origin of these books, which is set forth in the memoir of Rupert
Brooke, was simple and humble. I found, ten years ago, that there were a
number of writers doing work which appeared to me extremely good, but
which was narrowly known; and I thought that anyone, however
unprofessional and meagrely gifted, who presented a conspectus of it in
a challenging and manageable form might be doing a good turn both to the
poets and to the reading public. So, I think I may claim, it proved to
be. The first volume seemed to supply a want. It was eagerly bought; the
continuation of the affair was at once taken so much for granted as to
be almost unavoidable; and there has been no break in the demand for the
successive books. If they have won for themselves any position, there is
no possible reason except the pleasure they have given.<br>
<br>
Having entered upon a course of disclamation, I should like to make a
mild protest against a further charge that Georgian Poetry has merely
encouraged a small clique of mutually indistinguishable poetasters to
abound in their own and each other's sense or nonsense. It is natural
that the poets of a generation should have points in common; but to my
fond eye those who have graced these collections look as diverse as
sheep to their shepherd, or the members of a Chinese family to their
uncle; and if there is an allegation which I would <i>deny with both
hands</i>, it is this: that an insipid sameness is the chief
characteristic of an anthology which offers &mdash; to name almost at random
seven only out of forty (oh ominous academic number!) &mdash; the work of
Messrs. Abercrombie, Davies, de la Mare, Graves, Lawrence, Nichols and
Squire.<br>
<br>
The ideal <i>Georgian Poetry</i> &mdash; a book which would err neither by
omission nor by inclusion, and would contain the best, and only the best
poems of the best, and only the best poets of the day &mdash; could only be
achieved, if at all, by dint of a Royal Commission. The present volume
is nothing of the kind.<br>
<br>
I may add one word bearing on my aim in selection. Much admired modern
work seems to me, in its lack of inspiration and its disregard of form,
like gravy imitating lava. Its upholders may retort that much of the
work which I prefer seems to them, in its lack of inspiration and its
comparative finish, like tapioca imitating pearls. Either view &mdash; possibly
both &mdash; may be right. I will only say that with an occasional exception
for some piece of rebelliousness or even levity which may have taken my
fancy, I have tried to choose no verse but such as in Wordsworth's phrase

<blockquote>The high and tender Muses shall accept<br>
With gracious smile, deliberately pleased.</blockquote>

There are seven new-comers &mdash; Messrs. Armstrong, Blunden, Hughes, Kerr,
Prewett and Quennell, and Miss Sackville-West. Thanks and

<br>
<h3><i>Ryton Firs</i></h3><br>

<i>The Dream</i><br>

<blockquote>All round the knoll, on days of quietest air,<br>
Secrets are being told; and if the trees<br>
Speak out &mdash; let them make uproar loud as drums &mdash; <br>
'Tis secrets still, shouted instead of whisper'd.<br><br>

  There must have been a warning given once:<br>
No tree, on pain of withering and sawfly,<br>
To reach the slimmest of his snaky toes<br>
Into this mounded sward and rumple it;<br>
All trees stand back: taboo is on this soil. &mdash; <br><br>

  The trees have always scrupulously obeyed.<br>
The grass, that elsewhere grows as best it may<br>
Under the larches, countable long nesh blades,<br>
Here in clear sky pads the ground thick and close<br>
As wool upon a Southdown wether's back;<br>
And as in Southdown wool, your hand must sink<br>
Up to the wrist before it find the roots.<br>
A bed for summer afternoons, this grass;<br>
But in the Spring, not too softly entangling<br>
For lively feet to dance on, when the green<br>
Flashes with daffodils. From Marcle way,<br>
From Dymock, Kempley, Newent, Bromesberrow,<br>
Redmarley, all the meadowland daffodils seem<br>
Running in golden tides to Ryton Firs,<br>
To make the knot of steep little wooded hills<br>
Their brightest show: O bella età de l'oro!<br>
Now I breathe you again, my woods of Ryton:<br>
Not only golden with your daffodil-fires<br>
Lying in pools on the loose dusky ground<br>
Beneath the larches, tumbling in broad rivers<br>
Down sloping grass under the cherry trees<br>
And birches: but among your branches clinging<br>
A mist of that Ferrara-gold I first<br>
Loved in the easy hours then green with you;<br>
And as I stroll about you now, I have<br>
Accompanying me &mdash; like troops of lads and lasses<br>
Chattering and dancing in a shining fortune &mdash; <br>
Those mornings when your alleys of long light<br>
And your brown rosin-scented shadows were<br>
Enchanted with the laughter of my boys.</blockquote><br>

<i>The Voices in the Dream</i>

<blockquote>Follow my heart, my dancing feet,<br>
Dance as blithe as my heart can beat.<br>
Only can dancing understand<br>
What a heavenly way we pass<br>
Treading the green and golden land,<br>
Daffodillies and grass.<br><br>

I had a song, too, on my road,<br>
But mine was in my eyes;<br>
For Malvern Hills were with me all the way,<br>
Singing loveliest visible melodies<br>
Blue as a south-sea bay;<br>
And ruddy as wine of France<br>
Breadths of new-turn'd ploughland under them glowed.<br>
'Twas my heart then must dance<br>
To dwell in my delight;<br>
No need to sing when all in song my sight<br>
Moved over hills so musically made<br>
And with such colour played. &mdash; <br>
And only yesterday it was I saw<br>
Veil'd in streamers of grey wavering smoke<br>
My shapely Malvern Hills.<br>
That was the last hail-storm to trouble spring:<br>
He came in gloomy haste,<br>
Pusht in front of the white clouds quietly basking,<br>
In such a hurry he tript against the hills     <br>
And stumbling forward spilt over his shoulders   <br>
All his black baggage held,<br>
Streaking downpour of hail.<br>
Then fled dismayed, and the sun in golden glee<br>
And the high white clouds laught down his dusky ghost.<br><br>

For all that's left of winter<br>
Is moisture in the ground.<br>
When I came down the valley last, the sun<br>
Just thawed the grass and made me gentle turf,<br>
But still the frost was bony underneath.<br>
Now moles take burrowing jaunts abroad, and ply<br>
Their shovelling hands in earth<br>
As nimbly as the strokes<br>
Of a swimmer in a long dive under water.<br>
The meadows in the sun are twice as green<br>
For all the scatter of fresh red mounded earth,<br>
The mischief of the moles:<br>
No dullish red, Glostershire earth new-delved<br>
In April! And I think shows fairest where<br>
These rummaging small rogues have been at work.<br>
If you will look the way the sunlight slants<br>
Making the grass one great green gem of light,<br>
Bright earth, crimson and even<br>
Scarlet, everywhere tracks<br>
The rambling underground affairs of moles:<br>
Though 'tis but kestrel-bay<br>
Looking against the sun.<br><br>

But here's the happiest light can lie on ground,<br>
Grass sloping under trees<br>
Alive with yellow shine of daffodils!<br>
If quicksilver were gold,<br>
And troubled pools of it shaking in the sun<br>
It were not such a fancy of bickering gleam<br>
As Ryton daffodils when the air but stirs.<br>
And all the miles and miles of meadowland<br>
The spring makes golden ways,<br>
Lead here, for here the gold<br>
Grows brightest for our eyes,<br>
And for our hearts lovelier even than love.<br>
So here, each spring, our daffodil festival.<br><br>

How smooth and quick the year<br>
Spins me the seasons round!<br>
How many days have slid across my mind<br>
Since we had snow pitying the frozen ground!<br>
Then winter sunshine cheered<br>
The bitter skies; the snow,<br>
Reluctantly obeying lofty winds,<br>
Drew off in shining clouds,<br>
Wishing it still might love<br>
With its white mercy the cold earth beneath.<br>
But when the beautiful ground<br>
Lights upward all the air,<br>
Noon thaws the frozen eaves,<br>
And makes the rime on post and paling steam<br>
Silvery blue smoke in the golden day.<br>
And soon from loaded trees in noiseless woods<br>
The snows slip thudding down,<br>
Scattering in their trail<br>
Bright icy sparkles through the glittering air;<br>
And the fir-branches, patiently bent so long,<br>
Sigh as they lift themselves to rights again.<br>
Then warm moist hours steal in,<br>
Such as can draw the year's<br>
First fragrance from the sap of cherry wood<br>
Or from the leaves of budless violets;<br>
And travellers in lanes<br>
Catch the hot tawny smell           <br>
Reynard's damp fur left as he sneakt marauding   <br><br>

Across from gap to gap:<br>
And in the larch woods on the highest boughs<br>
The long-eared owls like grey cats sitting still<br>
Peer down to quiz the passengers below.<br><br>

Light has killed the winter and all dark dreams.<br>
Now winds live all in light,<br>
Light has come down to earth and blossoms here,<br>
And we have golden minds.<br>
From out the long shade of a road high-bankt,<br>
I came on shelving fields;<br>
And from my feet cascading,<br>
Streaming down the land,<br>
Flickering lavish of daffodils flowed and fell;<br>
Like sunlight on a water thrill'd with haste,<br>
Such clear pale quivering flame,<br>
But a flame even more marvellously yellow.<br>
And all the way to Ryton here I walkt<br>
Ankle-deep in light.<br>
It was as if the world had just begun;<br>
And in a mind new-made<br>
Of shadowless delight<br>
My spirit drank my flashing senses in,<br>
And gloried to be made<br>
Of young mortality.<br>
No darker joy than this<br>
Golden amazement now<br>
Shall dare intrude into our dazzling lives:<br>
Stain were it now to know<br>
Mists of sweet warmth and deep delicious colour,<br>
Those lovable accomplices that come<br>
Befriending languid hours.</blockquote>

<h3>The Buzzards</h3><br>


<blockquote>When evening came and the warm glow grew deeper <br>
And every tree that bordered the green meadows<br>
And in the yellow cornfields every reaper<br>
And every corn-shock stood above their shadows<br>
Flung eastward from their feet in longer measure,<br>
Serenely far there swam in the sunny height<br>
A buzzard and his mate who took their pleasure<br>
Swirling and poising idly in golden light.<br>
On great pied motionless moth-wings borne along,<br>
    So effortless and so strong,<br>
Cutting each other's paths, together they glided,<br>
Then wheeled asunder till they soared divided<br>
Two valleys' width (as though it were delight<br>
To part like this, being sure they could unite<br>
So swiftly in their empty, free dominion),<br>
Curved headlong downward, towered up the sunny steep,<br>
Then, with a sudden lift of the one great pinion,<br>
Swung proudly to a curve and from its height<br>
Took half a mile of sunlight in one long sweep.<br><br>

And we, so small on the swift immense hillside,<br>
Stood tranced, until our souls arose uplifted<br>
    On those far-sweeping, wide,<br>
Strong curves of flight, &mdash; swayed up and hugely drifted,<br>
Were washed, made strong and beautiful in the tide<br>
Of sun-bathed air. But far beneath, beholden<br>
Through shining deeps of air, the fields were golden<br>
And rosy burned the heather where cornfields ended.<br><br>

And still those buzzards wheeled, while light withdrew<br>
Out of the vales and to surging slopes ascended,<br>
Till the loftiest-flaming summit died to blue.</blockquote>

<a name="honhar"></a><h3>Honey Harvest</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Late in March, when the days are growing longer<br>
  And sight of early green<br>
Tells of the coming spring and suns grow stronger,<br>
Round the pale willow-catkins there are seen<br>
  The year's first honey-bees<br>
Stealing the nectar: and bee-masters know<br>
This for the first sign of the honey-flow.<br><br>

Then in the dark hillsides the Cherry-trees<br>
Gleam white with loads of blossom where the gleams<br>
Of piled snow lately hung, and richer streams<br>
The honey. Now, if chilly April days<br>
Delay the Apple-blossom, and the May's<br>
First week come in with sudden summer weather,<br>
The Apple and the Hawthorn bloom together,<br>
And all day long the plundering hordes go round<br>
And every overweighted blossom nods.<br>
But from that gathered essence they compound<br>
Honey more sweet than nectar of the gods.<br><br>

Those blossoms fall ere June, warm June that brings<br>
The small white Clover. Field by scented field,<br>
Round farms like islands in the rolling weald,<br>
It spreads thick-flowering or in wildness springs<br>
Short-stemmed upon the naked downs, to yield<br>
A richer store of honey than the Rose,<br>
The Pink, the Honeysuckle. Thence there flows<br>
Nectar of clearest amber, redolent<br>
  Of every flowery scent<br>
That the warm wind upgathers as he goes.<br><br>

In mid-July be ready for the noise<br>
Of million bees in old Lime-avenues,<br>
As though hot noon had found a droning voice<br>
To ease her soul. Here for those busy crews    <br>
Green leaves and pale-stemmed clusters of green strong flowers<br>
Build heavy-perfumed, cool, green-twilight bowers<br>
Whence, load by load, through the long summer days<br>
  They fill their glassy cells<br>
With dark green honey, clear as chrysoprase,<br>
Which housewives shun; but the bee-master tells<br>
This brand is more delicious than all else.<br><br>

In August-time, if moors are near at hand,<br>
Be wise and in the evening-twilight load<br>
Your hives upon a cart, and take the road<br>
By night: that, ere the early dawn shall spring<br>
And all the hills turn rosy with the Ling,<br>
  Each waking hive may stand<br>
Established in its new-appointed land<br>
Without harm taken, and the earliest flights<br>
Set out at once to loot the heathery heights.<br><br>

That vintage of the Heather yields so dense<br>
And glutinous a syrup that it foils<br>
Him who would spare the comb and drain from thence<br>
  Its dark, full-flavoured spoils:<br>
For he must squeeze to wreck the beautiful<br>
Frail edifice. Not otherwise he sacks<br>
Those many-chambered palaces of wax.<br><br>

Then let a choice of every kind be made,<br>
And, labelled, set upon your storehouse racks &mdash; <br>
Of Hawthorn-honey that of almond smacks:<br>
The luscious Lime-tree-honey, green as jade:<br>
Pale Willow-honey, hived by the first rover:<br>
  That delicate honey culled<br>
From Apple-blossom, that of sunlight tastes:<br>
And sunlight-coloured honey of the Clover.<br>
  Then, when the late year wastes,<br>
When night falls early and the noon is dulled<br>
  And the last warm days are over,<br>
Unlock the store and to your table bring<br>
Essence of every blossom of the spring.<br>
And if, when wind has never ceased to blow<br>
All night, you wake to roofs and trees becalmed<br>
  In level wastes of snow,<br>
Bring out the Lime-tree-honey, the embalmed<br>
Soul of a lost July, or Heather-spiced<br>
Brown-gleaming comb wherein sleeps crystallised<br>
All the hot perfume of the heathery slope.<br>
And, tasting and remembering, live in hope.</blockquote>

The bonnet trimmed with rusty plush,<br>
Peeped in the glass with simpering blush,<br>

Her thicker jacket off the hook<br>
Because the day might turn to cold.<br>
Then, ready, slipped downstairs and rolled<br>
The hearthrug back; then searched about,<br>
Found her basket, ventured out,<br>
Snecked the door and paused to lock it<br>
And plunge the key in some deep pocket.<br>
Then as she tripped demurely down<br>
The steep descent, the little town<br>
Spread wider till its sprawling street<br>
Enclosed her and her footfalls beat<br>
On hard stone pavement, and she felt<br>
Those throbbing ecstasies that melt<br>

Her small, prim personality<br>

Glossy as jet, and dull black bows;<br>
Slim ladies' shoes with two-inch heel<br>

  In a soft sward, no cattle might assail.<br><br>

And so I gathered mightiness and grew<br>
  With this one dream kindling in me, that I<br>
Should never cease from conquering light and dew<br>
  Till my white splendour touched the trembling sky.<br><br>

A century of blue and stilly light<br>
  Bowed down before me, the dew came again,<br>
The moon my sibyl worshipped through the night,<br>
  The sun returned and long abode; but then<br><br>

Hoarse drooping darkness hung me with a shroud<br>
  And switched at me with shrivelled leaves in scorn.<br>
Red morning stole beneath a grinning cloud,<br>
  And suddenly clambering over dike and thorn<br><br>

A half-moon host of churls with flags and sticks<br>
  Hallooed and hurtled up the partridge brood,<br>
And Death clapped hands from all the echoing thicks,<br>
  And trampling envy spied me where I stood;<br><br>

Who haled me tired and quaking, hid me by,<br>
  And came again after an age of cold,<br>
And hung me in the prison-house adry<br>
  From the great crossbeam. Here defiled and old<br><br>

I perish through unnumbered hours, I swoon,<br>
  Hacked with harsh knives to staunch a child's torn hand;<br>
And all my hopes must with my body soon<br>
  Be but as crouching dust and wind-blown sand.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>I came to the churchyard where pretty Joy lies<br>
  On a morning in April, a rare sunny day;<br>
Such bloom rose around, and so many birds' cries<br>
  That I sang for delight as I followed the way.<br><br>

I sang for delight in the ripening of spring,<br>
  For dandelions even were suns come to earth;<br>
Not a moment went by but a new lark took wing<br>
  To wait on the season with melody's mirth.<br><br>

Love-making birds were my mates all the road,<br>
  And who would wish surer delight for the eye<br>
Than to see pairing goldfinches gleaming abroad<br>
  Or yellowhammers sunning on paling and sty?<br><br>

And stocks in the almswomen's garden were blown,<br>
  With rich Easter roses each side of the door;<br>
The lazy white owls in the glade cool and lone<br>
  Paid calls on their cousins in the elm's chambered core.<br><br>

This peace, then, and happiness thronged me around.<br>
  Nor could I go burdened with grief, but made merry<br>
Till I came to the gate of that overgrown ground<br>
  Where scarce once a year sees the priest come to bury.<br><br>

Over the mounds stood the nettles in pride,<br>
  And, where no fine flowers, there kind weeds dared to wave;<br>
It seemed but as yesterday she lay by my side,<br>
  And now my dog ate of the grass on her grave.<br><br>

He licked my hand wondering to see me muse so,<br>
  And wished I would lead on the journey or home,<br>
As though not a moment of spring were to go<br>
  In brooding; but I stood, if her spirit might come<br><br>

And tell me her life, since we left her that day<br>
  In the white lilied coffin, and rained down our tears;<br>
But the grave held no answer, though long I should stay;<br>
  How strange that this clay should mingle with hers!<br><br>

So I called my good dog, and went on my way;<br>
  Joy's spirit shone then in each flower I went by,<br>
And clear as the noon, in coppice and ley,<br>
  Her sweet dawning smile and her violet eye!</blockquote>

<a name="aprbye"></a><h3>April Byeway</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Friend whom I never saw, yet dearest friend,<br>
  Be with me travelling on the byeway now<br>
In April's month and mood: our steps shall bend<br>
  By the shut smithy with its penthouse brow<br>
  Armed round with many a felly and crackt plough:<br>
And we will mark in his white smock the mill<br>
  Standing aloof, long numbed to any wind,<br>
That in his crannies mourns, and craves him still;<br>
  But now there is not any grain to grind,<br>
  And even the master lies too deep for winds to find.<br><br>

Grieve not at these: for there are mills amain<br>
  With lusty sails that leap and drop away<br>
On further knolls, and lads to fetch the grain.<br>
  The ash-spit wickets on the green betray<br>
  New games begun and old ones put away.<br>
Let us fare on, dead friend, O deathless friend,<br>
  Where under his old hat as green as moss<br>
The hedger chops and finds new gaps to mend,<br>
  And on his bonfires burns the thorns and dross,<br>
  And hums a hymn, the best, thinks he, that ever was.<br><br>

There the grey guinea-fowl stands in the way,<br>
  The young black heifer and the raw-ribbed mare,<br>
And scorn to move for tumbril or for dray,<br>
  And feel themselves as good as farmers there.<br>
  From the young corn the prick-eared leverets stare<br>
At strangers come to spy the land &mdash; small sirs,<br>
  We bring less danger than the very breeze<br>
Who in great zig-zag blows the bee, and whirs<br>
  In bluebell shadow down the bright green leas;<br>
  From whom in frolic fit the chopt straw darts and flees.<br><br>

The cornel steepling up in white shall know<br>
  The two friends passing by, and poplar smile<br>
All gold within; the church-top fowl shall glow<br>
  To lure us on, and we shall rest awhile<br>
  Where the wild apple blooms above the stile;<br>
The yellow frog beneath blinks up half bold,<br>
  Then scares himself into the deeper green.<br>
And thus spring was for you in days of old,<br>
  And thus will be when I too walk unseen<br>
  By one that thinks me friend, the best that there has been.<br><br>

All our lone journey laughs for joy, the hours<br>
  Like honey-bees go home in new-found light<br>
Past the cow pond amazed with twinkling flowers<br>
  And antique chalk-pit newly delved to white,<br>
  Or idle snow-plough nearly hid from sight.<br>
The blackbird sings us home, on a sudden peers<br>
  The round tower hung with ivy's blackened chains,<br>
Then past the little green the byeway veers,<br>
  The mill-sweeps torn, the forge with cobwebbed panes<br>
  That have so many years looked out across the plains.<br><br>

But the old forge and mill are shut and done,<br>
  The tower is crumbling down, stone by stone falls;<br>
An ague doubt comes creeping in the sun,<br>
  The sun himself shudders, the day appals,<br>
  The concourse of a thousand tempests sprawls<br>
Over the blue-lipped lakes and maddening groves,<br>
  Like agonies of gods the clouds are whirled,<br>
The stormwind like the demon huntsman roves &mdash; <br>
  Still stands my friend, though all's to chaos hurled,<br>
  The unseen friend, the one last friend in all the world.</blockquote>

'You silent robin, blackbird, thrush, and finch,<br>
  I'll sing enough for all you lazy kind!'<br><br>

And when I hear him at this daring task,<br>

Ofttimes since then their private lives<br>
Have spoilt that joy their music gives.<br><br>

So when I see this robin now,<br>
Like a red apple on the bough,<br>
And question why he sings so strong,<br>
For love, or for the love of song;<br>
Or sings, maybe, for that sweet rill<br>
Whose silver tongue is never still &mdash; <br><br>

Ah, now there comes this thought unkind,<br>
Born of the knowledge in my mind:<br>
He sings in triumph that last night<br>
He killed his father in a fight;<br>

<blockquote>The haze of noon wanned silver-grey,<br>
The soundless mansion of the sun;<br>
The air made visible in his ray,<br>
Like molten glass from furnace run,<br>
Quivered o'er heat-baked turf and stone<br>
And the flower of the gorse burned on &mdash; <br>
Burned softly as gold of a child's fair hair<br>
Along each spiky spray, and shed<br>
Almond-like incense in the air<br>
Whereon our senses fed.<br><br>

At foot &mdash; a few sparse harebells: blue<br>
And still as were the friend's dark eyes<br>
That dwelt on mine, transfixèd through<br>
With sudden ecstatic surmise.<br><br>

'Hst!' he cried softly, smiling, and lo,<br>
Stealing amidst that maze gold-green,<br>
I heard a whispering music flow<br>
From guileful throat of bird, unseen: &mdash; <br>
So delicate, the straining ear<br>
Scarce carried its faint syllabling<br>
Into a heart caught-up to hear<br>
That inmost pondering<br>
Of bird-like self with self. We stood,<br>
In happy trance-like solitude,<br>
Hearkening a lullay grieved and sweet &mdash; <br>
As when on isle uncharted beat<br>
'Gainst coral at the palm-tree's root,<br>
With brine-clear, snow-white foam afloat,<br>
The wailing, not of water or wind &mdash; <br>
A husht, far, wild, divine lament,      <br>
When Prospero his wizardry bent      <br>
Winged Ariel to bind....<br>
Then silence, and o'er-flooding noon.<br>
I raised my head; smiled too. And he &mdash; <br>
Moved his great hand, the magic gone &mdash; <br>
Gently amused to see<br>
My ignorant wonderment. He sighed.<br>
'It was a nightingale,' he said,<br>
'That <i>sotto voce</i> cons the song<br>
He'll sing when dark is spread;<br>
And Night's vague hours are sweet and long,<br>

Dance-bemused, with cheek aglow,<br>
Stooping the green-twined portal through,<br>
Sighing with laughter, debonair,<br>
That concourse of the proud and fair &mdash; <br>

Falls a small cry in the dark and calls &mdash; <br>

Venus, avers the astronomer,<br>

Flushing the eternal orchard with wild rose.<br>
She through ether burns<br>
Outpacing planetary earth,<br>
And ere two years triumphantly returns,<br>
And again wave-like swelling flows,<br>
And again her flashing apparition comes and goes.<br><br>

This we have not seen,<br>
No heavenly courses set,<br>
No flight unpausing through a void serene:<br>
But when eve clears,<br>
Arises Venus as she first uprose<br>
Stepping the shaken boughs among,<br>
And in her bosom glows<br>
The warm light hidden in sunny snows.<br><br>

She shakes the clustered stars<br>
Lightly, as she goes<br>
Amid the unseen branches of the night,<br>
Rose-limb'd, rose-bosom'd bright.<br><br>

She leaps: they shake and pale; she glows &mdash; <br>
And who but knows<br>
How the rejoiced heart aches<br>
When Venus all his starry vision shakes;<br><br>

When through his mind<br>
Tossing with random airs of an unearthly wind,<br>
Rose-bosom'd, rose-limb'd,<br>
The mistress of his starry vision arises,<br>
And the boughs glittering sway<br>
And the stars pale away,<br>
And the enlarging heaven glows<br>
As Venus light-foot mid the twined branches goes.</blockquote>

The sands where those now-sleeping young moon-bathers<br>
Came dripping out of the sea and from their arms<br>
Shook flakes of light, dancing on the foamy edge<br>
Of quiet waves. They were all things of light<br>
Tossed from the sea to dance under the Moon &mdash; <br>
Her nuns, dancing within her dying round,<br>
Clear limbs and breasts silvered with Moon and waves<br>
And quick with windlike mood and body's joy,<br>
Withdrawn from alien vows, by wave and wind<br>
Lightly absolved and lightly all forgetting.<br><br>

An hour ago they left. Remains the gleam<br>

As loveliest hues linger when the sun's gone<br>
And float in the heavens and die in reedy pools &mdash; <br>
So slowly, who shall say when light is gone?</blockquote>

Night after slow night, the starving mommets crept,<br>
Each following each, head to tail, day after day,<br>

I thought of you, long-heaving, horned green caterpillars,<br>
As I lay awake. My thoughts crawled each after each,<br>
Crawling at night each after each on the same nerve,<br>
An unbroken ring of thoughts too sore for speech.<br><br>

Over and over and over and over again<br>
The same hungry thoughts and the hopeless same regrets,<br>
Over and over the same truths, again and again<br>
In a heaving ring returning the same regrets.</blockquote>

Your ignorant eyes looked up into mine; and I knew<br>

<a name="pierglasg"></a><h3>The Pier-Glass</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Lost manor where I walk continually<br>
A ghost, while yet in woman's flesh and blood;<br>
Up your broad stairs mounting with outspread fingers<br>
And gliding steadfast down your corridors<br>
I come by nightly custom to this room,<br>
And even on sultry afternoons I come<br>
Drawn by a thread of time-sunk memory.<br><br>

Empty, unless for a huge bed of state<br>
Shrouded with rusty curtains drooped awry<br>
(A puppet theatre where malignant fancy<br>
Peoples the wings with fear). At my right hand<br>
A ravelled bell-pull hangs in readiness<br>
To summon me from attic glooms above<br>
Service of elder ghosts; here at my left<br>
A sullen pier-glass cracked from side to side<br>
Scorns to present the face as do new mirrors<br>
With a lying flush, but shows it melancholy<br>
And pale, as faces grow that look in mirrors.<br><br>

Is here no life, nothing but the thin shadow<br>
And blank foreboding, never a wainscot rat<br>
Rasping a crust? Or at the window pane<br>
No fly, no bluebottle, no starveling spider?<br>
The windows frame a prospect of cold skies<br>
Half-merged with sea, as at the first creation,<br>
Abstract, confusing welter. Face about,<br>
Peer rather in the glass once more, take note<br>
Of self, the grey lips and long hair dishevelled,<br>
Sleep-staring eyes. Ah, mirror, for Christ's love<br>
Give me one token that there still abides<br>
Remote, beyond this island mystery,<br>
So be it only this side Hope, somewhere,<br>
In streams, on sun-warm mountain pasturage,<br>
True life, natural breath; not this phantasma.<br><br>

A rumour, scarcely yet to be reckoned sound,<br>
But a pulse quicker or slower, then I know<br>
My plea is granted; death prevails not yet.<br>
For bees have swarmed behind in a close place<br>
Pent up between this glass and the outer wall.<br>
The combs are founded, the queen rules her court,<br>
Bee-sergeants posted at the entrance-chink<br>
Are sampling each returning honey-cargo<br>
With scrutinizing mouth and commentary,<br>
Slow approbation, quick dissatisfaction &mdash; <br>
Disquieting rhythm, that leads me home at last<br>
From labyrinthine wandering. This new mood<br>
Of judgment orders me my present duty,<br>
To face again a problem strongly solved<br>
In life gone by, but now again proposed<br>
Out of due time for fresh deliberation.<br>
Did not my answer please the Master's ear?<br>
Yet, I'll stay obstinate. How went the question,<br>
A paltry question set on the elements<br>
Of love and the wronged lover's obligation?<br>
<i>Kill or forgive?</i> Still does the bed ooze blood?<br>
Let it drip down till every floor-plank rot!<br>
Yet shall I answer, challenging the judgment: &mdash; <br>
<i>'Kill, strike the blow again, spite what shall come.'</i><br>
'Kill, strike, again, again,' the bees in chorus hum.</blockquote>

It seems my lady wept and the troll swore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  By Heaven he hated tears: he'd cure her spleen;<br>
Where she had begged one flower, he'd shower four-score,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A haystack bunch to amaze a China Queen.<br><br>

Cold fog-drawn Lily, pale mist-magic Rose<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He conjured, and in a glassy cauldron set<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With elvish unsubstantial Mignonette<br>
And such vague bloom as wandering dreams enclose.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she?<br>

<blockquote>The yellow sky grows vivid as the sun:<br>
The sea glittering, and the hills dun.<br><br>

The stones quiver. Twenty pounds of lead<br>
Fold upon fold, the air laps my head.<br><br>

Both eyes scorch: tongue stiff and bitter:<br>
Flies buzz, but no birds twitter:<br>
Slow bullocks stand with stinging feet,<br>
And naked fishes scarcely stir for heat.<br><br>

White as smoke,<br>
As jetted steam, dead clouds awoke<br>
And quivered on the Western rim.<br>
Then the singing started: dim<br>
And sibilant as rime-stiff reeds<br>
That whistle as the wind leads.<br>
The South whispered hard and sere,<br>
The North answered, low and clear;<br>
And thunder muffled up like drums<br>
Beat, whence the East wind comes.<br>
The heavy sky that could not weep<br>
Is loosened: rain falls steep:<br>
And thirty singing furies ride<br>
To split the sky from side to side.<br><br>

They sing, and lash the wet-flanked wind:<br>
Sing, from Col to Hafod Mynd,<br>
And fling their voices half a score<br>
Of miles along the mounded shore:<br>
Whip loud music from a tree,<br>
And roll their pæan out to sea<br>
Where crowded breakers fling and leap,<br>
And strange things throb five fathoms deep.<br><br>

The sudden tempest roared and died:<br>
The singing furies muted ride<br>
Down wet and slippery roads to hell:<br>
And, silent in their captors' train,<br>
Two fishers, storm-caught on the main:<br>
A shepherd, battered with his flocks;<br>
A pit-boy tumbled from the rocks;<br>
A dozen back-broke gulls, and hosts<br>
Of shadowy, small, pathetic ghosts,<br>
 &mdash; Of mice and leverets caught by flood;<br>
Their beauty shrouded in cold mud.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>When the slow year creeps hay-ward, and the skies<br>
Are warming in the summer's mild surprise,<br>
And the still breeze disturbs each leafy frond<br>
Like hungry fishes dimpling in a pond,<br>
It is a pleasant thing to dream at ease<br>
On sun-warmed thyme, not far from beechen trees.<br><br>

A robin flashing in a rowan-tree,<br>
A wanton robin, spills his melody<br>
As if he had such store of golden tones<br>
That they were no more worth to him than stones:<br>
The sunny lizards dream upon the ledges:<br>
Linnets titter in and out the hedges,<br>
Or swoop among the freckled butterflies.<br><br>

Down to a beechen hollow winds the track<br>
And tunnels past my twilit bivouac:<br>
Two spiring wisps of smoke go singly up<br>
And scarcely tremble in the leafy air.<br><br>

 &mdash; There are more shadows in this loamy cup<br>
Than God could count: and oh, but it is fair:<br>
The kindly green and rounded trunks, that meet<br>
Under the soil with twinings of their feet<br>
And in the sky with twinings of their arms:<br>
The yellow stools: the still ungathered charms<br>
Of berry, woodland herb, and bryony,<br>
And mid-wood's changeling child, Anemone.<br><br>

       *       *       *       *       *<br><br>

Quiet as a grave beneath a spire<br>
I lie and watch the pointed climbing fire,<br>
I lie and watch the smoky weather-cock<br>
That climbs too high, and bends to the breeze's shock,<br>
And breaks, and dances off across the skies<br>
Gay as a flurry of blue butterflies.<br><br>

But presently the evening shadows in,<br>
Heralded by the night-jar's solitary din<br>
And the quick bat's squeak among the trees;<br>
 &mdash; Who sudden rises, darting across the air<br>
To weave her filmy web in the Sun's bright hair<br>
That slowly sinks dejected on his knees....<br><br>

Now is he vanished: the bewildered skies<br>
Flame out a desperate and last surmise;<br>
Then yield to Night, their sudden conqueror.<br><br>

From pole to pole the shadow of the world<br>
Creeps over heaven, till itself is lit<br>
By the very many stars that wake in it:<br>
Sleep, like a messenger of great import,<br>
Lays quiet and compelling hands athwart<br>
The easy idlenesses of my mind.<br>
 &mdash; There is a breeze above me, and around:<br>
There is a fire before me, and behind:<br>
But Sleep doth hold me, and I hear no sound.<br><br>

In the far West the clouds are mustering,<br>
Without hurry, noise, or blustering:<br>
And soon as Body's nightly Sentinel<br>
Himself doth nod, I open furtive eyes....<br>
With darkling hook the Farmer of the Skies<br>
Goes reaping stars: they flicker, one by one,<br>
Nodding a little; tumble, &mdash; and are gone.</blockquote>

And I, like a second-comer, waiting.<br><br>

He lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,<br>
And looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,<br>
And flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused a moment,<br>
And stooped and drank a little more,<br>
Being earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels of the earth<br>
On the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.<br><br>

The voice of my education said to me<br>
He must be killed,<br>
For in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold are venomous.<br><br>

And voices in me said, If you were a man<br>
You would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.<br><br>

But must I confess how I liked him,<br>
How glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink at my water-trough<br>
And depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,<br>
Into the burning bowels of this earth?<br><br>

Was it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?<br>
Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?<br>
Was it humility, to feel honoured?<br>
I felt so honoured.<br><br>

And yet those voices:<br>
If you were not afraid you would kill him.<br><br>

And truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,<br>
But even so, honoured still more<br>
That he should seek my hospitality<br>
From out the dark door of the secret earth.<br><br>

He drank enough<br>
And lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,<br>
And flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,<br>
Seeming to lick his lips,<br>
And looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,<br>
And slowly turned his head,<br>
And slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,    <br>
Proceeded to draw his slow length curving round <br>
And climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.<br><br>

And as he put his head into that dreadful hole,<br>
And as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders, and entered further,<br>
A sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into that horrid black hole,<br>
Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself after,<br>
Overcame me now his back was turned.<br><br>

I looked round, I put down my pitcher,<br>
I picked up a clumsy log<br>
And threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.<br><br>

I think it did not hit him,<br>
But suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed in undignified haste,<br>
Writhed like lightning, and was gone<br>
Into the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,<br>
At which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.<br><br>

And immediately I regretted it.<br>
I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!<br>
I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.<br><br>

And I thought of the albatross,<br>
And I wished he would come back, my snake.<br><br>

For he seemed to me again like a king,<br>
Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,<br>
Now due to be crowned again.<br><br>

And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords<br>
Of life.<br>
And I have something to expiate:<br>
A pettiness.</blockquote>

But, as from that small hollow there<br>
Hosts of bright thistledown begin<br>
Their dazzling journey through the air,<br>
An idle man can only stare.<br><br>

They grip their withered edge of stalk<br>
In brief excitement for the wind;<br>
They hold a breathless final talk,<br>
And when their filmy cables part<br>
One almost hears a little cry.<br><br>

Some cling together while they wait,<br>
And droop and gaze and hesitate,<br>
But others leap along the sky,<br>
Or circle round and calmly choose<br>
The gust they know they ought to use;<br><br>

While some in loving pairs will glide,<br>
Or watch the others as they pass,<br>
Or rest on flowers in the grass,<br>
Or circle through the shining day<br>
Like silvery butterflies at play.<br><br>

Some catch themselves to every mound,<br>
Then lingeringly and slowly move<br>
As if they knew the precious ground<br>
Were opening for their fertile love:<br>
They almost try to dig, they need<br>
So much to plant their thistle-seed.</blockquote>

Oh! Fifty acres of living bread.<br>
The colour has painted itself in my heart;<br>
The form is patterned in my head.<br><br>

Hear it growing through every sound,<br>
Know exactly the sound it makes &mdash; <br>
Remembering, as one must all day,<br>
Under the pavement the live earth aches.<br><br>

Trees are at the farther end,<br>
Limes all full of the mumbling bee:<br>
So there must be a harvest field<br>

Hazy and cool, and breathing sweet.<br>
Round paradise is such a wall,<br>
And all the day, in such a way,<br>
In paradise the wild birds call.<br><br>

You only need to close your eyes<br>
And go within your secret mind,<br>
And you'll be into paradise:<br>

Some linden trees and drowsy bees,<br>
A tall sweet hedge with the corn behind.<br><br>

I will not have that harvest mown:<br>
I'll keep the corn and leave the bread.<br>
I've bought that field; it's now my own:<br>
I've fifty acres in my head.<br>

I give a blade of corn away.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Here, in this other world, they come and go<br>
With easy dream-like movements to and fro.<br>
They stare through lovely eyes, yet do not seek<br>
An answering gaze, or that a man should speak.<br>
Had I a load of gold, and should I come<br>
Bribing their friendship, and to buy a home,<br>
They would stare harder and would slightly frown:<br>
I am a stranger from the distant town.<br><br>

Oh, with what patience I have tried to win<br>
The favour of the hostess of the Inn!<br>
Have I not offered toast on frothing toast<br>
Looking toward the melancholy host;<br>
Praised the old wall-eyed mare to please the groom;<br>
Laughed to the laughing maid and fetched her broom;<br>
Stood in the background not to interfere<br>
When the cool ancients frolicked at their beer;<br>
Talked only in my turn, and made no claim<br>
For recognition or by voice or name,<br>
Content to listen, and to watch the blue<br>
Or grey of eyes, or what good hands can do?<br><br>

Sun-freckled lads, who at the dusk of day<br>
Stroll through the village with a scent of hay<br>
Clinging about you from the windy hill,<br>
Why do you keep your secret from me still?<br>
You loiter at the corner of the street;<br>
I in the distance silently entreat.<br>
I know too well I'm city-soiled, but then<br>
So are today ten million other men.<br>
My heart is true: I've neither will nor charms<br>
To lure away your maidens from your arms.<br>
Trust me a little. Must I always stand<br>
Lonely, a stranger from an unknown land?<br><br>

There is a riddle here. Though I'm more wise<br>

I find the meaning of their gentle look<br>
More difficult than any learned book.<br>
I pass: perhaps a moment you may chaff<br>
My walk, and so dismiss me with a laugh.<br>
I come: you all, most grave and most polite,<br>
Stand silent first, then wish me calm Good-Night.<br>
When I go back to town some one will say:<br>
'I think that stranger must have gone away.'<br>
And 'Surely!' some one else will then reply.<br>
Meanwhile, within the dark of London, I<br>
Shall, with my forehead resting on my hand,<br>
Not cease remembering your distant land;<br>
Endeavouring to reconstruct aright<br>
How some treed hill has looked in evening light;<br>
Or be imagining the blue of skies<br>
Now as in heaven, now as in your eyes;<br>
Or in my mind confusing looks or words<br>
Of yours with dawnlight, or the song of birds:<br>
Not able to resist, not even keep<br>
Myself from hovering near you in my sleep:<br>

As flowers to the purpose of the bee.</blockquote><br>

<h3>Night Rhapsody</h3>

<blockquote>How beautiful it is to wake at night,<br>
When over all there reigns the ultimate spell<br>
Of complete silence, darkness absolute,<br>
To feel the world, tilted on axle-tree,<br>
In slow gyration, with no sensible sound,<br>
Unless to ears of unimagined beings,<br>
Resident incorporeal or stretched<br>
In vigilance of ecstasy among<br>
Ethereal paths and the celestial maze.<br>
The rumour of our onward course now brings<br>
A steady rustle, as of some strange ship<br>
Darkling with soundless sail all set and amply filled<br>
By volume of an ever-constant air,<br>
At fullest night, through seas for ever calm,<br>
Swept lovely and unknown for ever on.<br><br>

How beautiful it is to wake at night,<br>
Embalmed in darkness watchful, sweet, and still,<br>
As is the brain's mood flattered by the swim<br>
Of currents circumvolvent in the void,<br>
To lie quite still and to become aware<br>
Of the dim light cast by nocturnal skies<br>
On a dim earth beyond the window-ledge,<br>
So, isolate from the friendly company<br>
Of the huge universe which turns without,<br>
To brood apart in calm and joy awhile<br>
Until the spirit sinks and scarcely knows<br>
Whether self is, or if self only is,<br>
For ever....<br><br>

         How beautiful to wake at night,<br>
Within the room grown strange, and still, and sweet,<br>
And live a century while in the dark<br>
The dripping wheel of silence slowly turns;<br>
To watch the window open on the night,<br>
A dewy silent deep where nothing stirs,<br>
And, lying thus, to feel dilate within<br>
The press, the conflict, and the heavy pulse<br>
Of incommunicable sad ecstasy,<br>
Growing until the body seems outstretched<br>
In perfect crucifixion on the arms<br>
Of a cross pointing from last void to void,<br>
While the heart dies to a mere midway spark.<br><br>

All happiness thou holdest, happy night,<br>
For such as lie awake and feel dissolved<br>
The peaceful spice of darkness and the cool<br>
Breath hither blown from the ethereal flowers<br>
That mist thy fields! O happy, happy wounds,<br>
Conditioned by existence in humanity,<br>
That have such powers to heal them! slow sweet sighs<br>
Torn from the bosom, silent wails, the birth<br>
Of such long-treasured tears as pain his eyes,<br>
Who, waking, hears the divine solicitudes<br>
Of midnight with ineffable purport charged.<br><br>

How beautiful it is to wake at night,<br>
Another night, in darkness yet more still,<br>
Save when the myriad leaves on full-fledged boughs,<br>
Filled rather by the perfume's wandering flood<br>
Than by dispansion of the still sweet air,<br>
Shall from the furthest utter silences<br>
In glimmering secrecy have gathered up<br>
An host of whisperings and scattered sighs,<br>
To loose at last a sound as of the plunge<br>
And lapsing seethe of some Pacific wave,<br>
Which, risen from the star-thronged outer troughs,<br>
Rolls in to wreathe with circling foam away<br>
The flutter of the golden moths that haunt<br>
The star's one glimmer daggered on wet sands.  <br><br>

So beautiful it is to wake at night!<br>
Imagination, loudening with the surf<br>
Of the midsummer wind among the boughs,<br>
Gathers my spirit from the haunts remote<br>
Of faintest silence and the shades of sleep,<br>
To bear me on the summit of her wave<br>
Beyond known shores, beyond the mortal edge<br>
Of thought terrestrial, to hold me poised<br>
Above the frontiers of infinity,<br>
To which in the full reflux of the wave<br>
Come soon I must, bubble of solving foam,<br>
Borne to those other shores &mdash; now never mine<br>
Save for a hovering instant, short as this<br>
Which now sustains me ere I be drawn back &mdash; <br>
To learn again, and wholly learn, I trust,<br>
How beautiful it is to wake at night.</blockquote><br>

<a name="novnich"></a><h3>November</h3>

<blockquote>As I walk the misty hill<br>
All is languid, fogged, and still;<br>
Not a note of any bird<br>
Nor any motion's hint is heard,<br>
Save from soaking thickets round<br>
Trickle or water's rushing sound,<br>
And from ghostly trees the drip<br>
Of runnel dews or whispering slip<br>
Of leaves, which in a body launch<br>
Listlessly from the stagnant branch<br>
To strew the marl, already strown,<br>
With litter sodden as its own,<br><br>

A rheum, like blight, hangs on the briars,<br>
And from the clammy ground suspires<br>
A sweet frail sick autumnal scent<br>
Of stale frost furring weeds long spent;<br>
And wafted on, like one who sleeps,<br>
A feeble vapour hangs or creeps,<br>
Exhaling on the fungus mould<br>
A breath of age, fatigue, and cold.<br><br>

Oozed from the bracken's desolate track,<br>
By dark rains havocked and drenched black.<br>
A fog about the coppice drifts,<br>
Or slowly thickens up and lifts<br>
Into the moist, despondent air.<br><br>

Mist, grief, and stillness everywhere....<br><br>

And in me, too, there is no sound<br>
Save welling as of tears profound,<br>
Where in me cloud, grief, stillness reign,<br>
And an intolerable pain <br>
Begins.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Rolled on as in a flood there come<br>
Memories of childhood, boyhood, home,<br>
And that which, sudden, pangs me most,<br>
Thought of the first-belov'd, long lost,<br>
Too easy lost! My cold lips frame<br>
Tremulously the familiar name,<br>
Unheard of her upon my breath:<br>
'Elizabeth. Elizabeth.'<br><br>

No voice answers on the hill,<br>
All is shrouded, sad, and still ...<br>
Stillness, fogged brakes, and fog on high.<br>
Only in me the waters cry<br>
Who mourn the hours now slipped for ever,<br>
Hours of boding, joy, and fever,<br>
When we loved, by chance beguiled,<br>
I a boy and you a child &mdash; <br>
Child! but with an angel's air,<br>
Astonished, eager, unaware,<br>
Or elfin's, wandering with a grace<br>
Foreign to any fireside race,<br>
And with a gaiety unknown<br>
In the light feet and hair backblown,<br>
And with a sadness yet more strange,<br>
In meagre cheeks which knew to change<br>
Or faint or fired more swift than sight,<br>
And forlorn hands and lips pressed white,<br>
And fragile voice, and head downcast,<br>
Hiding tears, lifted at the last<br>
To speed with one pale smile the wise<br>
Glance of the grey immortal eyes.<br><br>

How strange it was that we should dare<br>
Compound a miracle so rare<br>
As, 'twixt this pace and Time's next pace,<br>
Each to discern th' elected's face!<br>
Yet stranger that the high sweet fire,<br>
In hearts nigh foreign to desire,<br>
Could burn, sigh, weep, and burn again<br>
As oh, it never has since then!<br>
Most strange of all that we so young<br>
Dared learn but would not speak love's tongue,<br>
Love pledged but in the reveries<br>
Of our sad and dreaming eyes....<br><br>

Now upon such journey bound me,<br>
Grief, disquiet, and stillness round me,<br>
As bids me where I cannot tell,<br>
Turn I and sigh, unseen, farewell.<br>
Breathe the name as soft as mist,<br>
Lips, which nor kissed her nor were kissed!<br>
And again &mdash; a sigh, a death &mdash; <br>
'Elizabeth. Elizabeth.'<br><br>

No voice answers; but the mist<br>
Glows for a moment amethyst<br>
Ere the hid sun dissolves away,<br>
And dimness, growing dimmer grey,<br>
Hides all ... till nothing can I see<br>
But the blind walls enclosing me,<br>
And no sound and no motion hear<br>
But the vague water throbbing near,<br>
Sole voice upon the darkening hill<br>
Where all is blank and dead and still.</blockquote>

Here, mother, there is sunshine every day;<br>

But you I see out-plod a little way,<br>

Would you were here, we might in temples lie,<br>

But now 'tis time for sleep: I think no speech<br>

<br>
<blockquote>Morning and evening are mine,<br>
And the bright noon-day;<br>
But night to no man doth belong<br>
When the sad ghosts play.<br><br>

From Kelso town I took the road<br>
By the full-flood Tweed;<br>
The black clouds swept across the moon<br>
With devouring greed.<br><br>

Seek ye no peace who tread the night;<br>
I felt above my head<br>
Blowing the cloud's edge, faces wry<br>
In pale fury spread.<br><br>

Twelve surly elves were digging graves<br>
Beside black Eden brook;<br>
Eleven dug and stared at me,<br>
But one read in a book.<br><br>

In Birgham trees and hedges rocked,<br>
The moon was drowned in black;<br>
At Hirsel woods I shrieked to find<br>
A fiend astride my back.<br><br>

His legs he closed about my breast,<br>
His hands upon my head,<br>
Till Coldstream lights beamed in the trees<br>
And he wailed and fled.<br><br>

Morning and evening are mine,<br>
And the bright noon-heat,<br>
But at night the sad thin ghosts<br>
For their revels meet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As I went down the Baldon lane,<br>
Alone I went, as oft I went,<br>
Weighing if it were loss or gain<br>
To give a maidenhead.<br>
I met, just as the day was spent,<br>
A fancy man, a gentleman,<br>
Who smiled on me, and then began,<br>
'Come sit with me, my maid.'<br><br>

With him had I no mind to sit<br>
In Baldon lane for loss or gain,<br>
Said I to him with feeble wit,<br>
And close beside him crept;<br>
The branches might have heard my pain,<br>
The sudden cry, the maiden cry, &mdash; <br>
My fancy man departed sly,<br>
And woman-like, I wept.<br><br>

I kept the roads until my bed,<br>
A nine months' time, a weary time,<br>
And then to Baldon woods I fled<br>
In Spring-time weather mild;<br>
The kindly trees, they fear no crime,<br>
So back I came, to Baldon came,<br>
Received their welcome without blame,<br>
And moaned and dropped my child.<br><br>

The poor brat gasped an hour or so,<br>
A goodly child, a thoughtful child;<br>
Perceiving nought for us but woe<br>
It stretched and sudden died;<br>
But I, when Spring breaks fresh and mild,<br>
To Baldon lane return again,<br>
For there's my home, and women vain<br>
Must hold their homes in pride.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>Lying on Downs above the wrinkling bay<br>
I with the kestrels shared the cleanly day,<br>
The candid day; wind-shaven, brindled turf;<br>
Tall cliffs; and long sea-line of marbled surf<br>
From Cornish Lizard to the Kentish Nore<br>
Lipping the bulwarks of the English shore,<br>
While many a lovely ship below sailed by<br>
On unknown errand, kempt and leisurely;<br>
And after each, oh, after each, my heart<br>
Fled forth, as, watching from the Downs apart,<br>
I shared with ships good joys and fortunes wide<br>
That might befall their beauty and their pride;<br><br>

Shared first with them the blessèd void repose<br>
Of oily days at sea, when only rose<br>
The porpoise's slow wheel to break the sheen<br>
Of satin water indolently green,<br>
When for'ard the crew, caps tilted over eyes,<br>
Lay heaped on deck; slept; mumbled; smoked; threw dice;<br>
The sleepy summer days; the summer nights<br>
(The coast pricked out with rings of harbour-lights),<br>
The motionless nights, the vaulted nights of June<br>
When high in the cordage drifts the entangled moon,<br>
And blocks go knocking, and the sheets go slapping,<br>
And lazy swells against the sides come lapping;<br>
And summer mornings off red Devon rocks,<br>
Faint inland bells at dawn and crowing cocks;<br><br>

Shared swifter days, when headlands into ken<br>
Trod grandly; threatened; and were lost again,<br>
Old fangs along the battlemented coast;<br>
And followed still my ship, when winds were most<br>
Night-purified, and, lying steeply over,      <br>
She fled the wind as flees a girl her lover,     <br>
Quickened by that pursuit for which she fretted,<br>
Her temper by the contest proved and whetted.<br>
Wild stars swept overhead; her lofty spars<br>
Reared to a ragged heaven sown with stars<br>
As leaping out from narrow English ease<br>
She faced the roll of long Atlantic seas.<br><br>

Her captain then was I, I was her crew,<br>
The mind that laid her course, the wake she drew,<br>
The waves that rose against her bows, the gales, &mdash; <br>
Nay, I was more: I was her very sails<br>
Rounded before the wind, her eager keel,<br>
Her straining mast-heads, her responsive wheel,<br>
Her pennon stiffened like a swallow's wing;<br>
Yes, I was all her slope and speed and swing,<br>
Whether by yellow lemons and blue sea<br>
She dawdled through the isles off Thessaly,<br>
Or saw the palms like sheaves of scimitars<br>
On desert's verge below the sunset bars,<br>
Or passed the girdle of the planet where<br>
The Southern Cross looks over to the Bear,<br>
And strayed, cool Northerner beneath strange skies,<br>
Flouting the lure of tropic estuaries,<br>
Down that long coast, and saw Magellan's Clouds arise.<br><br>

And some that beat up Channel homeward-bound<br>
I watched, and wondered what they might have found,<br>
What alien ports enriched their teeming hold<br>
With crates of fruit or bars of unwrought gold?<br>
And thought how London clerks with paper-clips<br>
Had filed the bills of lading of those ships,<br>
Clerks that had never seen the embattled sea,<br>
But wrote down jettison and barratry,<br>
Perils, Adventures, and the Act of God,<br>
Having no vision of such wrath flung broad;<br>
Wrote down with weary and accustomed pen<br>
The classic dangers of sea-faring men;<br>
And wrote 'Restraint of Princes,' and 'the Acts<br>
Of the King's Enemies,' as vacant facts,<br>
Blind to the ambushed seas, the encircling roar<br>
Of angry nations foaming into war.</blockquote>

One that obeyed them mutely, as a child<br>
Submissive to a law he does not understand.<br><br>

They would not blame the sins his passion wrought.<br>
No, they were tolerant and Christian, saying, 'We<br>
Only deplore ...' saying they only sought<br>
To help him, strengthen him, to show him love; but he<br><br>

Following them with unrecalcitrant tread,<br>
Quiet, towards their town of kind captivities,<br>
Having slain rebellion, ever turned his head<br>
Over his shoulder, seeking still with his poor eyes<br><br>

Her motionless figure on the road. The song<br>
Rang still between them, vibrant bell to answering bell,<br>
Full of young glory as a bugle; strong;<br>
Still brave; now breaking like a sea-bird's cry 'Farewell!'<br><br>

And they, they whispered kindly to him 'Come!<br>
Now we have rescued you. Let your heart heal. Forget!<br>
She was your lawless dark familiar.' Dumb,<br>
He listened, and they thought him acquiescent. Yet,<br><br>

(Knowing the while that they were very kind)<br>
Remembrance clamoured in him: 'She was wild and free,<br>
Magnificent in giving; she was blind<br>
To gain or loss, and, loving, loved but me, &mdash; but me!<br><br>

'Valiant she was, and comradely, and bold;<br>
High-mettled; all her thoughts a challenge, like gay ships<br>
Adventurous, with treasure in the hold.<br>
I met her with the lesson put into my lips,<br><br>

'Spoke reason to her, and she bowed her head,<br>
Having no argument, and giving up the strife.<br>
She said I should be free. I think she said<br>
That, for the asking, she would give me all her life.'<br><br>

And still they led him onwards, and he still<br>
Looked back towards her standing there; and they, content,<br>
Cheered him and praised him that he did their will.<br>
The gradual distance hid them, and she turned, and went.</blockquote>

When race of wind is stilled and sails are furled,<br>
And underneath our single riding-light<br>

And slumbrous waters pool a slumbrous world;<br><br>

Old age might sink upon a windy youth,<br>
Quiet beneath the riding-light of truth,<br>
Weathered through storms, and gracious in retreat.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In silence and in darkness memory wakes<br>
Her million sheathèd buds, and breaks<br>
That day-long winter when the light and noise<br>
And hard bleak breath of the outward-looking will<br>
Made barren her tender soil, when every voice<br>
Of her million airy birds was muffled or still.<br><br>

One bud-sheath breaks:<br>
One sudden voice awakes.<br><br>

What change grew in our hearts, seeing one night<br>
That moth-winged ship drifting across the bay,<br>
      Her broad sail dimly white<br>
On cloudy waters and hills as vague as they?<br>
Some new thing touched our spirits with distant delight,<br>
Half-seen, half-noticed, as we loitered down,<br>
Talking in whispers, to the little town,<br>
      Down from the narrow hill<br>
       &mdash; Talking in whispers, for the air so still<br>
Imposed its stillness on our lips, and made<br><br>

A quiet equal with the equal shade<br>
That filled the slanting walk. That phantom now<br>
Slides with slack canvas and unwhispering prow<br>
Through the dark sea that this dark room has made.<br>
Or the night of the closed eyes will turn to day,<br>
And all day's colours start out of the gray.<br>
The sun burns on the water. The tall hills<br>
Push up their shady groves into the sky,<br>
And fail and cease where the intense light spills<br>
Its parching torrent on the gaunt and dry<br>
Rock of the further mountains, whence the snow<br>
That softened their harsh edges long is gone,<br>
      And nothing tempers now<br>
The hot flood falling on the barren stone.<br><br>

      O memory, take and keep<br>
All that my eyes, your servants, bring you home &mdash; <br>
Those other days beneath the low white dome<br>
      Of smooth-spread clouds that creep<br>
      As slow and soft as sleep,<br>
When shade grows pale and the cypress stands upright,<br>
      Distinct in the cool light,<br>
Rigid and solid as a dark hewn stone;<br>
      And many another night,<br>
That melts in darkness on the narrow quays,<br>
And changes every colour and every tone,<br>
And soothes the waters to a softer ease,<br>
When under constellations coldly bright<br>
The homeward sailors sing their way to bed<br>
On ships that motionless in harbour float.<br>
The circling harbour-lights flash green and red;<br>
And, out beyond, a steady travelling boat,<br>
Breaking the swell with slow industrious oars,<br>
      At each stroke pours<br>
Pale lighted water from the lifted blade.<br>
Now in the painted houses all around<br>
      Slow-darkening windows call<br>
The empty unwatched middle of the night.<br>
The tide's few inches rise without a sound.<br>
On the black promontory's windless head,<br>
The last awake, the fireflies rise and fall<br>
And tangle up their dithering skeins of light.<br><br>

      O memory, take and keep<br>
All that my eyes, your servants, bring you home!<br>
      Thick through the changing year<br>
The unexpected, rich-charged moments come, <br>
      That you twixt wake and sleep<br>
In the lids of the closed eyes shall make appear.<br><br>

      This is life's certain good,<br>
Though in the end it be not good at all<br>
      When the dark end arises,<br>
And the stripped, startled spirit must let fall<br>
      The amulets that could<br>
Prevail with life's but not death's sad devices.<br><br>

Then, like a child from whom an older child<br>
      Forces its gathered treasures,<br>
Its beads and shells and strings of withered flowers,<br>
      Tokens of recent pleasures,<br>
The soul must lose in eyes weeping and wild<br>
      Those prints of vanished hours.</blockquote>

Only a show for dead love's sake,<br>
    It being so piteous?<br><br>

No more against my bosom press thee,<br>
Seek no more that my hands caress thee,<br>
    Leave the sad lips thou hast known so well;<br>
If to my heart thou lean thine ear,<br>
There grieving thou shalt only hear<br>
    Vain murmuring of an empty shell.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>Blow harder, wind, and drive<br>
My blood from hands and face back to the heart.<br>
Cry over ridges and down tapering coombs,<br>
Carry the flying dapple of the clouds<br>
Over the grass, over the soft-grained plough,<br>
Stroke with ungentle hand the hill's rough hair<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       Against its usual set.<br>
Snatch at the reins in my dead hands and push me<br>
Out of my saddle, blow my labouring pony<br>
Across the track. You only drive my blood<br>
Nearer the heart from face and hands, and plant there,<br>
Slowly burning, unseen, but alive and wonderful,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A numb, confusèd joy!<br>
This little world's in tumult. Far away<br>
The dim waves rise and wrestle with each other<br>
And fall down headlong on the beach. And here<br>
Quick gusts fly up the funnels of the valleys<br>
And meet their raging fellows on the hill-tops,<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       And we are in the midst.<br>
This beating heart, enriched with the hands' blood,<br>
Stands in the midst and feels the warm joy burn<br>
In solitude and silence, while all about<br>
The gusts clamour like living, angry birds,<br>
And the gorse seems hardly tethered to the ground.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Blow louder, wind, about<br>
My square-set house, rattle the windows, lift<br>
The trap-door to the loft above my head<br>
And let it fall, clapping. Yell in the trees,<br>
And throw a rotted elm-branch to the ground,<br>
Flog the dry trailers of my climbing rose &mdash; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Make deep, O wind, my rest!</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>The leafless trees, the untidy stack<br>
  Last rainy summer raised in haste,<br>
Watch the sky turn from fair to black<br>
  And watch the river fill and waste;<br><br>

But never a footstep comes to trouble<br>
  The sea-gulls in the new-sown corn,<br>
Or pigeons rising from late stubble<br>
  And flashing lighter as they turn.<br><br>

Or if a footstep comes, 'tis mine<br>
  Sharp on the road or soft on grass:<br>
Silence divides along my line<br>
  And shuts behind me as I pass.<br><br>

No other comes, no labourer<br>
  To cut his shaggy truss of hay,<br>
Along the road no traveller,<br>
  Day after day, day after day.<br><br>

And even I, when I come here,<br>
  Move softly on, subdued and still,<br>
Lonely as death, though I can hear<br>
  Men shouting on the other hill.<br><br>

Day after day, though no one sees,<br>
  The lonely place no different seems;<br>
The trees, the stack, still images<br>
  Constant in who can say whose dreams?</blockquote>

<h3>Elegy</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>I vaguely wondered what you were about,<br>
  But never wrote when you had gone away;<br>
Assumed you better, quenched the uneasy doubt<br>
  You might need faces, or have things to say.<br>
  Did I think of you last evening? Dead you lay.<br>
    O bitter words of conscience!<br>
    I hold the simple message,<br>
And fierce with grief the awakened heart cries out:<br>
    'It shall not be to-day;<br><br>

It is still yesterday; there is time yet!'<br>
  Sorrow would strive backward to wrench the sun,<br>
But the sun moves. Our onward course is set,<br>
  The wake streams out, the engine pulses run<br>
  Droning, a lonelier voyage is begun.<br>
    It is all too late for turning,<br>
    You are past all mortal signal,<br>
There will be time for nothing but regret<br>
    And the memory of things done!<br><br>

The quiet voice that always counselled best,<br>
  The mind that so ironically played<br>
Yet for mere gentleness forebore the jest.<br>
  The proud and tender heart that sat in shade<br>
  Nor once solicited another's aid,<br>
    Yet was so grateful always<br>
    For trifles lightly given,<br>
The silences, the melancholy guessed<br>
    Sometimes, when your eyes strayed.<br><br>

But always when you turned, you talked the more.<br>
  Through all our literature your way you took<br>
With modest ease; yet would you soonest pore,<br>
  Smiling, with most affection in your look,<br>
  On the ripe ancient and the curious nook.<br>
    Sage travellers, learnèd printers,<br>
    Divines and buried poets,<br>
You knew them all, but never half your lore<br>
    Was drawn from any book.<br><br>

Stories and jests from field and town and port,<br>
  And odd neglected scraps of history<br>
From everywhere, for you were of the sort,<br>
  Cool and refined, who like rough company:<br>
  Carter and barmaid, hawker and bargee,<br>
    Wise pensioners and boxers<br>
    With whom you drank, and listened<br>
To legends of old revelry and sport<br>
    And customs of the sea.<br><br>

I hear you: yet more clear than all one note,<br>
  One sudden hail I still remember best,<br>
That came on sunny days from one afloat<br>
  And drew me to the pane in certain quest<br>
  Of a long brown face, bare arms and flimsy vest,<br>
    In fragments through the branches,<br>
    Above the green reflections:<br>
Paused by the willows in your varnished boat<br>
    You, with your oars at rest.<br><br>

Did that come back to you when you were dying?<br>
  I think it did: you had much leisure there,<br>
And, with the things we knew, came quietly flying<br>
  Memories of things you had seen we knew not where.<br><br>

  You watched again with meditative stare<br>
    Places where you had wandered,<br>
    Golden and calm in distance:<br>
Voices from all your altering past came sighing<br>
    On the soft Hampshire air.<br><br>

For there you sat a hundred miles away,<br>
  A rug upon your knees, your hands gone frail,<br>
And daily bade your farewell to the day,<br>
  A music blent of trees and clouds a-sail<br>
  And figures in some old neglected tale:<br>
    And watched the sunset gathering,<br>
    And heard the birdsong fading,<br>
And went within when the last sleepy lay<br>
    Passed to a farther vale,<br><br>

Never complaining, and stepped up to bed<br>
  More and more slow, a tall and sunburnt man<br>
Grown bony and bearded, knowing you would be dead<br>
  Before the summer, glad your life began<br>
  Even thus to end, after so short a span,<br>
    And mused a space serenely,<br>
    Then fell to easy slumber,<br>
At peace, content. For never again your head<br>
    Need make another plan.<br><br>

Most generous, most gentle, most discreet,<br>
  Who left us ignorant to spare us pain:<br>
We went our ways with too forgetful feet<br>
  And missed the chance that would not come again,<br>
  Leaving with thoughts on pleasure bent, or gain,<br>
    Fidelity unattested<br>
    And services unrendered:<br>
The ears are closed, the heart has ceased to beat,<br>
    And now all proof is vain.<br><br>

Too late for other gifts, I give you this,<br>
  Who took from you so much, so carelessly,<br>
On your far brows a first and phantom kiss,<br>
  On your far grave a careful elegy.<br>
  For one who loved all life and poetry,<br>
    Sorrow in music bleeding,<br>
    And friendship's last confession.<br>
But even as I speak that inner hiss<br>
    Softly accuses me,<br><br>

Saying: Those brows are senseless, deaf that tomb,<br>
  This is the callous, cold resort of art.<br>
'I give you this.' What do I give? to whom?<br>
  Words to the air, and balm to my own heart,<br>
  To its old luxurious and commanded smart.<br>
    An end to all this tuning,<br>
    This cynical masquerading;<br>
What comfort now in that far final gloom<br>
    Can any song impart?<br><br>

O yet I see you dawning from some heaven,<br>
  Who would not suffer self-reproach to live<br>
In one to whom your friendship once was given.<br>
  I catch a vision, faint and fugitive,<br>
Of a dark face with eyes contemplative,<br>
    Deep eyes that smile in silence,<br>
    And parted lips that whisper,<br>
'Say nothing more, old friend, of being forgiven,<br>
    There is nothing to forgive.'</blockquote>

<a name="medlampsq"></a><h3>Meditation in Lamplight</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>What deaths men have died, not fighting but impotent.<br>
Hung on the wire, between trenches, burning and freezing,<br>
Groaning for water with armies of men so near;<br>
The fall over cliff, the clutch at the rootless grass,<br>
The beach rushing up, the whirling, the turning headfirst;<br>
Stiff writhings of strychnine, taken in error or haste,<br>
Angina pectoris, shudders of the heart;<br>
Failure and crushing by flying weight to the ground,<br>
Claws and jaws, the stink of a lion's breath;<br>
Swimming, a white belly, a crescent of teeth,<br>
Agony, and a spirting shredded limb,<br>
And crimson blood staining the green water;<br>
And, horror of horrors, the slow grind on the rack,<br>
The breaking bones, the stretching and bursting skin,<br>
Perpetual fainting and waking to see above<br>
The down-thrust mocking faces of cruel men,<br>
With the power of mercy, who gloat upon shrieks for mercy.<br><br>

O pity me, God! O God, make tolerable,<br>
Make tolerable the end that awaits for me,<br>
And give me courage to die when the time comes,<br>
When the time comes as it must, however it comes,<br>
That I shrink not nor scream, gripped by the jaws of the vice;<br>
For the thought of it turns me sick, and my heart stands still,<br>
Knocks and stands still. O fearful, fearful Shadow,<br>
Kill me, let me die to escape the terror of thee!<br><br>

A tap. Come in! Oh, no, I am perfectly well,<br>
Only a little tired. Take this one, it's softer.<br>
How are things going with you? Will you have some coffee?<br>
Well, of course it's trying sometimes, but never mind,<br>
It will probably be all right. Carry on, and keep cheerful.<br>
I shouldn't, if I were you, meet trouble half-way,<br>
It is always best to take everything as it comes.</blockquote>

<a name="latesnw"></a><h3>Late Snow</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>The heavy train through the dim country went rolling, rolling,<br>
Interminably passing misty snow-covered plough-land ridges<br>
That merged in the snowy sky; came turning meadows, fences,<br>
Came gullies and passed, and ice-coloured streams under frozen bridges.<br><br>

Across the travelling landscape evenly drooped and lifted<br>
The telegraph wires, thick ropes of snow in the windless air;<br>
They drooped and paused and lifted again to unseen summits,<br>
Drawing the eyes and soothing them, often, to a drowsy stare.<br><br>

Singly in the snow the ghosts of trees were softly pencilled,<br>
Fainter and fainter, in distance fading, into nothingness gliding,<br>
But sometimes a crowd of the intricate silver trees of fairyland<br>
Passed, close and intensely clear, the phantom world hiding.<br><br>

O untroubled these moving mantled miles of shadowless shadows,<br>
And lovely the film of falling flakes; so wayward and slack;<br>
But I thought of many a mother-bird screening her nestlings,<br>
Sitting silent with wide bright eyes, snow on her back.</blockquote>

<h3>Seascape</h3>
<br>
<blockquote>Over that morn hung heaviness, until,<br>
Near sunless noon, we heard the ship's bell beating<br>
A melancholy staccato on dead metal;<br>
Saw the bare-footed watch come running aft;<br>
Felt, far below, the sudden telegraph jangle<br>
Its harsh metallic challenge, thrice repeated:<br>
<i>Stand to. Half-speed ahead. Slow. Stop her!</i><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                             They stopped.<br>
The plunging pistons sank like a stopped heart:<br>
She held, she swayed, a hulk, a hollow carcass<br>
Of blistered iron that the grey-green, waveless,<br>
Unruffled tropic waters slapped languidly.<br><br>

And, in that pause, a sinister whisper ran:<br>
Burial at Sea! a Portuguese official ...<br>
Poor fever-broken devil from Mozambique:<br>
Came on half tight: the doctor calls it heat-stroke.<br>
Why do they travel steerage? It's the exchange:<br>
So many million <i>reis</i> to the pound!<br>
What did he look like? No one ever saw him:<br>
Took to his bunk, and drank and drank and died.<br>
They're ready! Silence!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                     We clustered to the rail,<br>
Curious and half-ashamed. The well-deck spread<br>
A comfortable gulf of segregation<br>
Between ourselves and death. <i>Burial at sea</i> ...<br>
The master holds a black book at arm's length;<br>
His droning voice comes for'ard: <i>This our brother ...<br>
We therefore commit his body to the deep<br>
To be turned into corruption</i> ... The bo's'n whispers<br>
Hoarsely behind his hand: <i>Now, all together!</i><br>
The hatch-cover is tilted; a mummy of sailcloth<br>
Well ballasted with iron shoots clear of the poop;<br>
Falls, like a diving gannet. The green sea closes<br>
Its burnished skin; the snaky swell smoothes over ...<br>
While he, the man of the steerage, goes down, down,<br>
Feet foremost, sliding swiftly down the dim water,<br>
Swift to escape<br>
Those plunging shapes with pale, empurpled bellies<br>
That swirl and veer about him. He goes down<br>
Unerringly, as though he knew the way<br>
Through green, through gloom, to absolute watery darkness,<br>
Where no weed sways nor curious fin quivers:<br>
To the sad, sunless deeps where, endlessly,<br>
A downward drift of death spreads its wan mantle<br>
In the wave-moulded valleys that shall enfold him<br>
Till the sea give up its dead.<br><br>

There shall he lie dispersed amid great riches:<br>
Such gold, such arrogance, so many bold hearts!<br>
All the sunken armadas pressed to powder<br>
By weight of incredible seas! That mingled wrack<br>
No livening sun shall visit till the crust<br>
Of earth be riven, or this rolling planet<br>
Reel on its axis; till the moon-chained tides,<br>
Unloosed, deliver up that white Atlantis<br>
Whose naked peaks shall bleach above the slaked<br>
Thirst of Sahara, fringed by weedy tangles<br>
Of Atlas's drown'd cedars, frowning eastward<br>
To where the sands of India lie cold,<br>
And heap'd Himalaya's a rib of coral<br>
Slowly uplifted, grain on grain....<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                                  We dream<br>
Too long! Another jangle of alarum<br>
Stabs at the engines: <i>Slow. Half-speed. Full-speed!</i><br>
The great bearings rumble; the screw churns, frothing                <br>
Opaque water to downward-swelling plumes<br>
Milky as wood-smoke. A shoal of flying-fish<br>
Spurts out like animate spray. The warm breeze wakens;<br>
And we pass on, forgetting,<br>
Toward the solemn horizon of bronzed cumulus<br>
That bounds our brooding sea, gathering gloom<br>
That, when night falls, will dissipate in flaws<br>
Of watery lightning, washing the hot sky,<br>
Cleansing all hearts of heat and restlessness,<br>
Until, with day, another blue be born.</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>Out of that high pavilion<br>
Where the sick, wind-harassed sun<br>
In the whiteness of the day<br>
Ghostly shone and stole away &mdash; <br>
Parchèd with the utter thirst<br>
Of unnumbered Libyan sands,<br>
Thou, cloud-gathering spirit, burst<br>
Out of arid Africa<br>
To the tideless sea, and smote<br>
On our pale, moon-coolèd lands<br>
The hot breath of a lion's throat.<br><br>

And that furnace-heated breath<br>
Blew into my placid dreams<br>
The heart of fire from whence it came:<br>
Haunt of beauty and of death<br>
Where the forest breaks in flame<br>
Of flaunting blossom, where the flood<br>
Of life pulses hot and stark,<br>
Where a wing'd death breeds in mud<br>
And tumult of tree-shadowed streams &mdash; <br>
Black waters, desolately hurled<br>
Through the uttermost, lost, dark,<br>
Secret places of the world.<br><br>

There, O swift and terrible<br>
Being, wast thou born; and thence,<br>
Like a demon loosed from hell,<br>
Stripped with rending wings the dense<br>
Echoing forests, till their bowed<br>
Plumes of trees like tattered cloud<br>
Were toss'd and torn, and cried aloud<br>
As the wood were rack'd with pain:<br>
Thence thou freed'st thy wings, and soon<br>
From the moaning, stricken plain     <br>
In whorled eagle-soarings rose    <br>
To melt the sun-defeating snows<br>
Of the Mountains of the Moon,<br>
To dull their glaciers with fierce breath,<br>
To slip the avalanches' rein,<br>
To set the laughing torrents free<br>
On the tented desert beneath,<br>
Where men of thirst must wither and die<br>
While the vultures stare in the sun's eye;<br>
Where slowly sifting sands are strown<br>
On broken cities, whose bleaching bones<br>
Whiten in moonlight stone on stone.<br><br>

Over their pitiful dust thy blast<br>
Passed in columns of whirling sand,<br>
Leapt the desert and swept the strand<br>
Of the cool and quiet sea,<br>
Gathering mighty shapes, and proud<br>
Phantoms of monstrous, wave-born cloud,<br>
And northward drove this panoply<br>
Till the sky seemed charging on the land....<br><br>

Yet, in that plumèd helm, the most<br>
Of thy hot power was cooled or lost,<br>
So that it came to me at length,<br>
Faint and tepid and shorn of strength,<br>
To shiver an olive-grove that heaves<br>
A myriad moonlight-coloured leaves,<br>
And in the stone-pine's dome set free<br>
A murmur of the middle sea:<br>
A puff of warm air in the night<br>
So spent by its impetuous flight<br>
It scarce invades my pillar'd closes, &mdash; <br>
To waft their fragrance from the sweet<br>
Buds of my lemon-coloured roses<br>
Or strew blown petals at my feet:<br>
To kiss my cheek with a warm sigh<br>
And in the tired darkness die.</blockquote>

<a name="quailsy"></a><h3>The Quails</h3>
<br>
<i>(In the south of Italy the peasants put out the eyes of a captured
quail so that its cries may attract the flocks of spring migrants into
their nets.)</i><br>
<br>

<blockquote>All through the night<br>
I have heard the stuttering call of a blind quail,<br>
A caged decoy, under a cairn of stones,<br>
Crying for light as the quails cry for love.<br><br>

Other wanderers,<br>
Northward from Africa winging on numb pinions, dazed<br>
With beating winds and the sobbing of the sea,<br>
Hear, in a breath of sweet land-herbage, the call<br>
Of the blind one, their sister....<br>
Hearing, their fluttered hearts<br>
Take courage, and they wheel in their dark flight,<br>
Knowing that their toil is over, dreaming to see<br>
The white stubbles of Abruzzi smitten with dawn,<br>
And spilt grain lying in the furrows, the squandered gold<br>
That is the delight of quails in their spring mating.<br><br>

Land-scents grow keener,<br>
Penetrating the dank and bitter odour of brine<br>
That whitens their feathers;<br>
Far below, the voice of their sister calls them<br>
To plenty, and sweet water, and fulfilment.<br>
Over the pallid margin of dim seas breaking,<br>
Over the thickening in the darkness that is land,<br>
They fly. Their flight is ended. Wings beat no more.<br>
Downward they drift, one by one, like dark petals,<br>
Slowly, listlessly falling<br>
Into the mouth of horror:<br>
The nets....<br><br>

Where men come trampling and crying with bright lanterns,<br>
Plucking their weak, entangled claws from the meshes of net,<br>
Clutching the soft brown bodies mottled with olive,<br>
Crushing the warm, fluttering flesh, in hands stained with blood,<br>
Till their quivering hearts are stilled, and the bright eyes,<br>
That are like a polished agate, glaze in death.<br><br>

But the blind one, in her wicker cage, without ceasing<br>
Haunts this night of spring with her stuttering call,<br>
Knowing nothing of the terror that walks in darkness,<br>
Knowing only that some cruelty has stolen the light<br>
That is life, and that she must cry until she dies.<br><br>

I, in the darkness,<br>
Heard, and my heart grew sick. But I know that to-morrow<br>
A smiling peasant will come with a basket of quails<br>
Wrapped in vine-leaves, prodding them with blood-stained fingers,<br>
Saying, 'Signore, you must cook them thus, and thus,<br>
With a sprig of basil inside them.' And I shall thank him,<br>
Carrying the piteous carcases into the kitchen<br>
Without a pang, without shame.<br><br>

'Why should I be ashamed? Why should I rail<br>
Against the cruelty of men? Why should I pity,<br>
Seeing that there is no cruelty which men can imagine<br>
To match the subtle dooms that are wrought against them<br>
By blind spores of pestilence: seeing that each of us,<br>
Lured by dim hopes, flutters in the toils of death<br>
On a cold star that is spinning blindly through space <br>
Into the nets of time?'         <br><br>

So cried I, bitterly thrusting pity aside,<br>
Closing my lids to sleep. But sleep came not,<br>
And pity, with sad eyes,<br>
Crept to my side, and told me<br>
That the life of all creatures is brave and pityful<br>
Whether they be men, with dark thoughts to vex them,<br>
Or birds, wheeling in the swift joys of flight,<br>
Or brittle ephemerids, spinning to death in the haze<br>
Of gold that quivers on dim evening waters;<br>
Nor would she be denied.<br>
The harshness died<br>
Within me, and my heart<br>
Was caught and fluttered like the palpitant heart<br>
Of a brown quail, flying<br>
To the call of her blind sister,<br>
And death, in the spring night.</blockquote>

For the waters that drowned her mountains<br>
        Washed their beauty away.<br><br>

Were there women in the ways of Atlantis:<br>
Foolish women, who loved, as I do,<br>
Dreaming that mortal love was deathless?<br>

There was no woman in all her mountains<br>
        Wonderful as thou!</blockquote>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
